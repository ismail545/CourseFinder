# UniLink / CourseFinder
This is a program which immediately opens the correct course material online. It is much quicker than doing so manually, and it allows the 
user to make more use of his time elsewhere. It also saves the frustration of reading through all 11 or so module titles to find the 
right one. 


## Installation
To use this program you should pip install Selenium, and then install web chromedriver. Enter the location of the chromedriver into the
code.


## Future Updates
I am interested in packing the chromedriver with the code to save users configuration time. 
To use the program, call it from the command line, and enter the correct parameter.
